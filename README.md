# Perform exploratory data analysis using GPT and prompt engineering




In this repo, we’ll cover:

* Set up an OpenAI developer account and integrate it with Python environment.
* Utilizing the chat functionality in the OpenAI API, with and without langchain.
* Perform prompt engineering.
* Build longer conversations with GPT.
* Ideas for incorporating GPT into a data analysis or data science workflow.

We will explore electric vehicle dataset (This dataset shows the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered through Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL).)

What is Open AI API and LangChain?

Open AI API — Open AI has released an API for accessing new AI models developed by OpenAI. Unlike most AI systems which are designed for one use-case, this API provides general-purpose “text in, text out” interface, allowing users to try it on virtually any English language task.

LangChain — LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It connects a language model to sources of context (prompt instructions, content to ground its response in, etc.) and rely on a language model to reason (about how to answer based on provided context, what actions to take, etc.)
